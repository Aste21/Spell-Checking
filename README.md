# spell-checking
Spell checking using hamming, levenshtein and indel distance.

Program calculating levenshtein distance, hamming distance and indel distance. For levenshtein and hamming distance, there is a second version ignoring simple miss types like typing 'o' instead of 'p'.  There is a simple autocorrect implementation using hamming distance and a words database ("words_alpha.txt"). The program also has a function taking a txt file as input, autocorrecting every word, and sending output to a second txt file.
